# backplane-rasPI-ic880a
Backplane for connecting IC880a with Rasperry PI
#### What is it?
The Board is a simple backplane to connect the IMST IC880A (https://wireless-solutions.de/products/radiomodules/ic880a.html) with an Raspberry PI (2 Model B or above). For the IC880A the backplane supplies power from the Raspberry PI, so the internal fuses from the Raspberry PI are in use, i think better as supply the power on the backplane. (If using PIN2&6 you bypassing fuse of the Raspberry PI).

#### Why did you make it?###
I want to use the backplane instead of wiring with jumper cables to avoid potential interferences. And a backplane is more professional and smarten then using jumper cables....

#### What makes it special?
There is nothing special, a simple backplane to connect a few PINs of two boards.
